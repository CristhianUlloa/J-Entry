		  		J Entry is a friendly and welcoming place where you can always find people to hang out with. We often leave our doors open so that people can stop to talk as they pass by, and there are always people in our lounges p-setting, procrastinating, or just hanging out (or sometimes all of them at once!) in the evenings and until the wee hours of the morning. As one of the smallest entries, we are very close-knit, which provides us not only with a fun place to hang out with friends in our free time, but also a great support network anytime we’re having trouble with something. We try to create a friendly, caring, family-like atmosphere that makes J Entry a place where you can relax, be yourself, and feel at home. J Entry is a place where you can come to have a great time with fun people, but also one where you can find peace and quiet when you need it.
		  	</p>
		  	<p>
					We have weekly study breaks here in J, at which we celebrate the weekend by taking time out to have fun together! Study break traditions include our Thanksgiving potluck, J-Idol, a bowling trip, restaurant outings, tie-dyeing, a hiking trip, our holiday gift exchange, and the Easter piñata, just to name a few. We also have weekly(-ish) brownie nights to take a break during the week, and the magical Birthday Fairy makes us cakes to celebrate our birthdays! Other things our residents enjoy together are movies, food, puzzles, board games, and staying up late hanging out in the lounge.

            Hi! I'm a lightweight rower and wannabe Canadian who enjoys spending my free time terrorizing J-1 in a pikachu onesie. I enjoy music, art, running, and making it my mission to kick ass, go to space, and represent the human race.
          </p>
					<h4>Why I Love J Entry:</h4>
					<p>
            I love the quirkiness and the genuine support and care that everyone shows for each other here. Whenever I'm having a bad day or need help with something, my entry is always there to make it better.

          </p>
					<h4>Why I Love J Entry:</h4>
					<p>
            I can be myself in J. I can hang out with and talk about the most random crap with people at almost anytime. People even appreciate bad jokes and puns! :D It's a very relaxed place filled with great people :)

            David is a low-key jenizen who tends to listen to solid jams and read comic books in his free time. He has a strong interest in chemistry and the other natural sciences, and appreciates odd puns, stoic wit, and dark humor. The only thing he likes more than sarcasm is writing about himself in the third person.

					<p>
            Hi
          </p>
          <p>
            I am a sophomore.
          </p>
          <p>
            I like pop-tarts, memes, and Arizona Black and White Tea.
          </p>
          <p>
            Outside of these, I enjoy things such as Star Wars, Back to the Future, Pixar stuff, Civilization, GTA, Skyrim, Mass Effect, KotOR, Apocalypse Rising, Star Trek, Spongebob, and a lot of other stuff. For a full list of my interests, please contact me at epw@mit.edu.
          </p>
          <p>
            In my free time (procrastination time), I'll watch TeenNick while laying on my futon, bum around Boston, take a walk to McDonald's, or do some indie game development.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is possible (however unlikely) that I will occasionally go overboard on my love for Tesla Motors and SpaceX. Don't worry, though; this is primarily a ploy to get on Jonathan's nerves (check him out if you haven't, already. 10/10 would recommend).
          </p>
					<h4>Why I Love J Entry:</h4>
					<p>
            J is the best. It's obviously difficult to summarize why, but I'll attempt to.
          </p>
          <p>
            When I participated in in-house rush, many entries wowed me with their quirks, food, and conversation. J Entry, however, provided me with a little more. I made real connections, and was able to be completely myself without feeling whatsoever out of place. I could tell from the start that I would make great friends here.
          </p>
          <p>
            We play video games, watch movies, troll each other (if you need trolling lessons just come over to J2 and ask for Kevin), eat food, walk around Boston, playfully debate, make art, and meme together.
          </p>
          <p>
            This obviously isn't a complete list. But whether you need an exercise partner, a debate about austerity measures in Greece, pop-tarts, movie and music suggestions, someone to go on late night adventures with you, or some spare paperclips to bind a pset together, you can find it in J.
          </p>
          <p>
            And that's a beautiful thing.
          </p>

					<h4>Bio:</h4>
					<p>
						A course 14 pretentious tryhard from northern Michigan. I spend most of my free time chilling around J Entry, at Hayden Library or listening to hipster trash (e.g. indie rock, experimental electronic, and hip hop). Sometimes I play Civilization and then remember how bad I am at it and stop.
					</p>
					<p>
						Interests include: Whining about the system, procrastinating, apple juice, listening to vaporwave at 4AM while eating pizza rolls
					</p>
					<h4>Why I Love J Entry:</h4>
					<p>
						J Entry is a cool, caring community (but not in a cheesy 70's sitcom kind of way); your friends here will always look out for you. It's a great group of people from diverse interests and backgrounds, and we've also got a (relatively) laid-back culture. Also sometimes we go to IHOP at 2AM which is excellent.

            Hey, its nice to meet youse guys. My name is Jonathan and I'm from the wonderful city of Philadelphia.  I'm really fascinated by materials how they limit our technological world. I hope to one day work on new super alloys that can other, much more clever individuals, can mold into the most amazing machines. I like to bring my Philly attitude and a slice of the Mediterranean to my less gastronomically educated friends. Good life, good tech, good eats.
					</p>
					<h4>Why I Love J Entry:</h4>
					<p>
            J-Entry is easy going, approachable, and fun. We are all pretty low key people that you can see yourself playing your favorite game with, watching a movie, or maybe even knocking out a few problem sets. We're like Jello, but please, only the green kind, not the red, the red is just nasty I honestly cant figure out why people even serve that chaff to people these days. Anyways, like Jello, we bounce around while remaining a relatively comfortable, consistent facet of your residential life.

					<h4>Why I Love J Entry:</h4>
					<p>
            Sarcastic, funny, and interesting peeps. I'm terrible at writing these descriptions because there are too many adjectives. Every individual brings a different element of J to the table. Sometimes it results in utter chaos, but in a good way.

						Hello! My name is Kevin and I live on J2. I am one of J Entry's social chairs, so it's my job to make sure that you have ample opportunity to meet people and get exposed to all the shenanigans of the entry. I hail from New Jersey and love things that go fast. I work on the Formula SAE team at MIT and take cars very seriously. I'm one of J2's insomniacs and you can always find me in my room at 3AM (sometimes working, sometimes just watching racecar videos (because racecar)). I also really enjoy riding my road bike with others when there isn't 3 feet of snow on the ground.
					</p>
					<h4>Why I Love J Entry:</h4>
					<p>
						J entry is all about people. I think that the combination of characters that we have in the entry is truly unique and is endlessly entertaining. The sense of camaraderie in the entry is really the distinguishing factor of J entry and not every living group on campus has the same dynamic.

            Android developer, 6.01 TA, connoisseur of memes and the Internet at large.  Nintendo fangirl and sick Skyrim spellsword.  I like books and Netflix (omg Game of Thrones).  I enjoy lounging and lolz.
					</p>
					<h4>Why I Love J Entry:</h4>
					<p>
            I was basically adopted by J entry my junior year, after forming a p-set group with a couple residents.  I was amazed at how welcoming and friendly the entry is and how quickly I became friends with anybody new I met while working in the lounge.  Soon enough it was obvious that I should move in with all of my favorite people, so I could stop walking over freezing in my pajamas to play Pokemon at 2am instead.  J entry is the most caring and supportive community I've encountered at MIT, and if you're facing a tough week you can be certain there are friends here who will cheer you up, help you out, and maybe even surprise you with late-night chocolate cake.  And that's not to mention all the shenanigans we get up to involving bad puns, worse trolls, and spontaneous adventures.  It's home!

            So this might sound cheesy and/or it might be said a lot, but J-entry is really my home away from home. The residents really are my surrogate family, and in many cases, even more awesome than my ""actual"" family, but shhh don't tell them I said that ;p

            I love that J is such a community and on any given afternoon/evening there are usually at least a couple people hanging out in the entry lounge, whether they're psetting, watching a tv show, playing a video game, having a lively debate, sharing a meal, or just chilling.
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm so happy I found J and that I have the privilege of living with such awesome people!

            J is an awesome place because of its residents. You won't find a more fun, interesting, welcoming group of folks anywhere else!

					<h4>Bio:</h4>
					<p>
            I am J's resident Brit, sharing the delights of the Isles with the other members of the Entry and the people of America: devotion to Queen and country; appreciation for British wit and charm; a taste for tea and the other finer things in life; education in the correct spelling of things. I am course 2 with a passion for course 22 and will probably end up double majoring. I enjoy running (especially spontaneous sprint races), play the guitar from time to time, and juggle when the feeling takes me.
					</p>
					<h4>Why I Love J Entry:</h4>
					<p>
            Though it has become something of a cliché, I think it is right to state that the people in J enjoy working hard and playing hard. There are always people in the lounge to have a chat and banter with; when you need some quiet, you will be able to find a place to work in peace. We have a large range of complementary personalities and lots of different interests, and I found it very easy to fit in.

					<h4>Bio:</h4>
					<p>
						I'm pretty regular. I did a lot of stuff at MIT - I was in a sorority, and part of Gospel Choir, E33, DanceTroupe, and MacG exec, so I was never bored. I'm a decent cook, and always down for sharing. I got introduced to Doctor Who my sophomore year and fell in love - and possibly binge watched it for the next two years. I love chocolate and our dessert study breaks. I think watching scary movies on Halloween is a must, even though I can't handle them. Apparently I make entertaining faces also. I graduated this past year and am working for Accenture as a technology consultant in the D.C. area.
					</p>
					<h4>Why I Love J Entry:</h4>
					<p>
						I had a bad dorm experience freshman year and was considering leaving MIT after a difficult year. The J entry GRT took me in and invited me to the annual senior dinner. The other residents immediately started making fun of me, so I knew I would fit in. I moved in after that and found what I was looking for in a dorm - people to be there when I was stressed or sad, to have intelligent (or non-intelligent) conversations with, to say goodnight to, to watch scary movies with, to go out to impromptu dinners with, to watch Doctor Who with, and a million other things. J entry is one of the main reasons I stayed at MIT, and I can honestly say I don't have a single bad memory of living there.

					<p>
            Greetings! I am Tricia, former Social Chair, Entry Chair, Supreme Overlord of Reimbursements, Keeper of the Google Docs, Crafter of Titles, and so on. I lived in the same room in J Entry my entire time at MIT. My proudest achievement is the formation of J2 as my legion of underclassman trolls. I was a leader of the campaign to educate all Jenizens in the things that are important in life - namely great movies they should have seen, such as Star Wars, The Lord of the Rings, Back to the Future, and Indiana Jones. I was Mama J for a time, and had weekly brownie nights for the entry, then became Grandma J and now Great Grandma J in my old age. I enjoy video games, hiking, terrible puns, Star Wars and Spongebob references, trolling Kevin, going on middle-of-the-night (or daytime) adventures around Boston, and probably some other things.
					</p>
					<h4>Why I Love J Entry:</h4>
					<p>
            It has been said before and it will be said again - the best thing about J Entry is the people. I came to MIT worried about making friends. During REX, I focused very hard on trying to find a place where I could make friends and be happy. One night, as I was wandering through MacGregor, a Jenizen found me and brought me to J Entry. I had fun hanging about in the lounge for a while that night with several residents, but what happened next was more important - I found myself coming back again the next few nights. Hanging out in J was fun, and more importantly, felt naturally fun, not forced like a lot of REX events, where it obviously isn't like that during the school year (AKA most of the time). I genuinely love the people in J, and I am so glad that it's where I wound up. I even became Social Chair and later Entry Chair - something I never would have seen myself getting involved in before - because of how much I liked J and wanted to make it even more awesome.
          </p>
          <p>
            J Entry is a tight-knit place full of friendly, caring, fun individuals, and above all else, feels like a home. J is also just the right kind of fun for me - in a given week, you might experience an all-night p-set party in the main lounge (punctuated by our favorite YouTube videos), covering the whole end of the hallway in a web of yarn with your neighbors, a movie marathon, fresh-baked desserts, a spontaneous outing into Boston, or a long chain of terrible, terrible puns. The friends I have made in J are the closest I have. Alas, four years is far too short a time to live among such excellent and admirable Hobbits.

            Hi! I graduated from MIT in 2009 but loved it so much I stayed for grad school (x2, MD and PhD!). I like to run, play board games, do research, and live in J-Entry as one of your GRTs!
					</p>
					<h4>Why I Love J Entry:</h4>
					<p>
            I love the people -- everyone in J is super friendly, and its a great place to live!!  There are always people to hang out with :)

			<h1>Our J Entry Traditions</h1>
	  	<p>
	  		In J we like to try all sorts of things. A lot of what we do is spontaneous, unique and unreproducible!
	      However, we also have some traditions that we try to keep, and we'd like to share some of those with you here.

      <h3>Lounge-Dwelling</h3>
      <p>
        In true MIT fashion, we (or at least some of us) like to procrastinate! So rather than focus on our work alone in our lovely singles we sometimes work in lounges just for the company and casual goofing around. Occasionally we find ourselves distracted...
      </p>

      <h3>Trolling and Pranks</h3>
	  	<p>
        Have you ever heard the troll song originally sung by Eduard Khil? Well, don’t worry if you haven’t, because you’ll hear plenty of it when you live here! We love playing pranks on each other, no matter how silly they might be. Be forewarned! Troll or be trolled in this entry! And FYI, if you really do love the troll action, be sure to check out J2 for the daily Ron-talks-to-Kevin show that never fails to amuse.
	  	</p>

      <h3>Thanksgiving Potluck</h3>
	  	<p>
        Because Thanksgiving is all ‘bout that food!! Every year we each make some small dish or something for Thanksgiving and then get together to try and eat it all (we always fail). But hey, leftovers are good too, right? :D
	  	</p>

      <h3>Winter Gift Exchange</h3>
      <p>
        Right before Christmas time we have a gift exchange (white elephant/yankee swap type thing) within J. People buy some silly gifts and have a ball trying to take the best ones for ourselves (for some definitions of best).
      </p>

      <h3>Senior Dinner</h3>
      <p>
        Every year we like to dress up fancy pancy and go out to some restaurant to enjoy a nice dinner with our entry’s seniors as a sort-of farewell. We usually try to wrap up the night by spending time talking about (usually funny and embarrassing) memories/moments with the seniors.
      </p>

      <h3>Stressed Desserts</h3>
      <p>
        When under stress, one of the first impulses is to pig out on junk food and anything that offers you a delicious taste at maximum cost to your personal health, so why not do it with friends? Once a semester, when we sense that the stress is getting high due to a ton of assignments/tests, we have a “Stressed Desserts” study break (stressed = desserts spelled backwards :D) where we can all pig out together and vent out all of our academic and personal frustrations at the world and MIT.
      </p>

      <h3>Bad Puns</h3>
      <p>
        They say laughter is great way to handle stress, and at in J, we spend a lot of time laughing. Jokes are a great way to do so, but as we are engineers and not liberal arts majors, our jokes can often come across as knee-slappers or super nerdy (don’t worry, once you start hanging out with people in your major, those puns will really take off). Sometimes, we have those awkward moments when almost everyone misses the joke. But ultimately, bad or good, awkward or not awkward, we love to make puns: they’re a great way to break out of the monotony that is PSets and classes.
      </p>

      <h3>Bowling</h3>
      <p>
        Every semester or so we venture out to the wilderness known as Alewife (actually, just the end of the Red Line) and compete for eternal glory. The game? Bowling.
      </p>

      <!-- <h3>Hiking</h3> -->

      <!--
      <h3>Apple Picking and Baking</h3>
      <p>

      </p>
    -->

      <h3>Brownie Night</h3>
      <p>
        Every week or so in the evening, we chow down on some delicious, fresh-baked brownies. It serves as a great break between studying/work, and everyone has a good time.
      </p>

      <!-- <h3>Birthday Fairy</h3> -->

      <!-- <h3>Mama J</h3> -->

      <!-- <h3>Easter Brunch</h3> -->

      <h3>Finals Breakfasts</h3>
      <p>
        During finals week, our lovely GRTs provide us with breakfast so we have one less thing to worry about during this stressful time. It’s a great time to relax before exams, hang out, and wish each other the best of luck!
      </p>
