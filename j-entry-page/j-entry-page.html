		  		J Entry is a friendly and welcoming place where you can always find people to hang out with. We often leave our doors open so that people can stop to talk as they pass by, and there are always people in our lounges p-setting, procrastinating, or just hanging out (or sometimes all of them at once!) in the evenings and until the wee hours of the morning. As one of the smallest entries, we are very close-knit, which provides us not only with a fun place to hang out with friends in our free time, but also a great support network anytime we’re having trouble with something. We try to create a friendly, caring, family-like atmosphere that makes J Entry a place where you can relax, be yourself, and feel at home. J Entry is a place where you can come to have a great time with fun people, but also one where you can find peace and quiet when you need it.
		  	</p>
		  	<p>
					We have weekly study breaks here in J, at which we celebrate the weekend by taking time out to have fun together! Study break traditions include our Thanksgiving potluck, J-Idol, a bowling trip, restaurant outings, tie-dyeing, a hiking trip, our holiday gift exchange, and the Easter piñata, just to name a few. We also have weekly(-ish) brownie nights to take a break during the week, and the magical Birthday Fairy makes us cakes to celebrate our birthdays! Other things our residents enjoy together are movies, food, puzzles, board games, and staying up late hanging out in the lounge.

					<h4>Bio:</h4>
					<p>
						A course 14 pretentious tryhard from northern Michigan. I spend most of my free time chilling around J Entry, at Hayden Library or listening to hipster trash (e.g. indie rock, experimental electronic, and hip hop). Sometimes I play Civilization and then remember how bad I am at it and stop.
					</p>
					<p>
						Interests include: Whining about the system, procrastinating, apple juice, listening to vaporwave at 4AM while eating pizza rolls
					</p>
					<h4>Why I Love J Entry:</h4>
					<p>
						J Entry is a cool, caring community (but not in a cheesy 70's sitcom kind of way); your friends here will always look out for you. It's a great group of people from diverse interests and backgrounds, and we've also got a (relatively) laid-back culture. Also sometimes we go to IHOP at 2AM which is excellent.

					<h4>Bio:</h4>
					<p>
						Hello! My name is Kevin and I live on J2. I am one of J Entry's social chairs, so it's my job to make sure that you have ample opportunity to meet people and get exposed to all the shenanigans of the entry. I hail from New Jersey and love things that go fast. I work on the Formula SAE team at MIT and take cars very seriously. I'm one of J2's insomniacs and you can always find me in my room at 3AM (sometimes working, sometimes just watching racecar videos (because racecar)). I also really enjoy riding my road bike with others when there isn't 3 feet of snow on the ground.
					</p>
					<h4>Why I Love J Entry:</h4>
					<p>
						J entry is all about people. I think that the combination of characters that we have in the entry is truly unique and is endlessly entertaining. The sense of camaraderie in the entry is really the distinguishing factor of J entry and not every living group on campus has the same dynamic.

					<h4>Bio:</h4>
					<p>
						I'm pretty regular. I did a lot of stuff at MIT - I was in a sorority, and part of Gospel Choir, E33, DanceTroupe, and MacG exec, so I was never bored. I'm a decent cook, and always down for sharing. I got introduced to Doctor Who my sophomore year and fell in love - and possibly binge watched it for the next two years. I love chocolate and our dessert study breaks. I think watching scary movies on Halloween is a must, even though I can't handle them. Apparently I make entertaining faces also. I graduated this past year and am working for Accenture as a technology consultant in the D.C. area.
					</p>
					<h4>Why I Love J Entry:</h4>
					<p>
						I had a bad dorm experience freshman year and was considering leaving MIT after a difficult year. The J entry GRT took me in and invited me to the annual senior dinner. The other residents immediately started making fun of me, so I knew I would fit in. I moved in after that and found what I was looking for in a dorm - people to be there when I was stressed or sad, to have intelligent (or non-intelligent) conversations with, to say goodnight to, to watch scary movies with, to go out to impromptu dinners with, to watch Doctor Who with, and a million other things. J entry is one of the main reasons I stayed at MIT, and I can honestly say I don't have a single bad memory of living there.

		  		In J we like to try all sorts of things. A lot of what we do is spontaneous, unique and unreproducible.
          However, we also have some traditions that we try to keep and we'd like to share some of those with you here.

		  <div id="entry-description" class="col-md-8">
        <h3>Thanksgiving Potluck</h3>
		  	<p>
          Because Thanksgiving is all ‘bout that food!! Every year we each make some small dish or something for Thanksgiving and then get together to try and eat it all (we always fail). But hey, leftovers are good too, right? :D
		  	</p>

        <h3>Trolling/Pranks</h3>
		  	<p>
          Have you ever heard the troll song originally sung by Edward Khil?  Well don’t worry if you haven’t, because you’re going to hear plenty of it when you live here!  We love playing pranks on each other, no matter how juvenile they might be.  Be forewarned!  Troll or be trolled in this entry!  And FYI, if you really do love the troll action, be sure to check out J2 for the daily Ron-talks-to-Kevin show that never fails to amuse.
		  	</p>

        <h3>Winter Gift Exchange</h3>
        <p>
          Right before Christmas time we have a gift exchange (white elephant/yankee swap type thing) within J. People buy some silly gifts and have a ball trying to take the best ones for ourselves.
        </p>

        <h3>Senior Dinner</h3>
        <p>
          Every year we like to dress up fancy pancy and go out to some restaurant to enjoy a nice dinner with our entry’s seniors as a sort-of farewell. We usually try to wrap up the night by spending time talking about (funny and embarrassing) memories/moments with the seniors.
        </p>

        <h3>Bowling</h3>
        <p>
          Every semester or so we venture out to the wilderness known as Alewife (actually, just the end of the red line) and compete for eternal glory. The game? Bowling.
        </p>

        <!-- <h3>Hiking</h3> -->

        <h3>Lounge Dwelling</h3>
        <p>
          In true MIT fashion, we (or at least some of us) like to procrastinate! So rather than focus on our work alone in our lovely singles we sometimes work in lounges just for the company and casual goofing around. Occasionally we find ourselves distracted...
        </p>

        <!--
        <h3>Apple Picking and Baking</h3>
        <p>

        </p>
      -->

        <h3>Brownie Night</h3>
        <p>
          Every week or so in the evening, we chow down on some delicious brownies.  It’s serves as a great break between studying/work, and everyone has a good time.  Oh and sorry to disappoint anyone, but they’re not laced with pot...at least last time I checked…
        </p>

        <!-- <h3>Birthday Fairy</h3> -->

        <!-- <h3>Mama J</h3> -->

        <!-- <h3>Easter Brunch</h3> -->

        <h3>Finals Breakfast</h3>
        <p>
          During finals week our lovely GRTs provide us with breakfast so we have one less thing to worry about during this stressful time. It’s a great time to relax before exams, hang out, and wish each other the best of luck!
        </p>

        <h3>Stressed Desserts</h3>
        <p>
          When under stress, one of the first impulses is to pig out on junk food and anything that offers you a delicious taste at maximum cost to your personal health, so why not do it with friends?  Once a semester, when we sense that the stress is getting high due to a ton of assignments/tests, we have a “Stressed Desserts” study break (stressed = desserts spelled backwards :D) where we can all pig out together and vent out all of our academic and personal frustrations at the world and MIT.
        </p>

        <!-- <h3>Teaching Study Break</h3> -->

        <h3>Bad Puns</h3>
        <p>
          They say laughter is great way to handle stress, and at MIT, we spend a lot of time laughing.  Jokes are a great way to do so, but as we are engineers and not liberal arts majors, our jokes can often come across as knee-slappers or super nerdy (don’t worry, once you start hanging out with people in your major, those puns will really take off).  Sometimes, we have those awkward moments when almost everyone misses the joke.  But ultimately, bad or good, awkward or not awkward, we love to make puns: they’re a great way to break out of the monotony that is PSets and classes.
