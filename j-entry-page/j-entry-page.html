		  		J Entry is a friendly and welcoming place where you can always find people to hang out with. We often leave our doors open so that people can stop to talk as they pass by, and there are always people in our lounges p-setting, procrastinating, or just hanging out (or sometimes all of them at once!) in the evenings and until the wee hours of the morning. As one of the smallest entries, we are very close-knit, which provides us not only with a fun place to hang out with friends in our free time, but also a great support network anytime we’re having trouble with something. We try to create a friendly, caring, family-like atmosphere that makes J Entry a place where you can relax, be yourself, and feel at home. J Entry is a place where you can come to have a great time with fun people, but also one where you can find peace and quiet when you need it.
		  	</p>
		  	<p>
					We have weekly study breaks here in J, at which we celebrate the weekend by taking time out to have fun together! Study break traditions include our Thanksgiving potluck, J-Idol, a bowling trip, restaurant outings, tie-dyeing, a hiking trip, our holiday gift exchange, and the Easter piñata, just to name a few. We also have weekly(-ish) brownie nights to take a break during the week, and the magical Birthday Fairy makes us cakes to celebrate our birthdays! Other things our residents enjoy together are movies, food, puzzles, board games, and staying up late hanging out in the lounge.

		  		In J we like to try all sorts of things. A lot of what we do is spontaneous, unique and unreproducible.
          However, we also have some traditions that we try to keep and we'd like to share some of those with you here.

        <h3>Thanksgiving Potluck</h3>
		  	<p>
          Because Thanksgiving is all ‘bout that food!! Every year we each make some small dish or something for Thanksgiving and then get together to try and eat it all (we always fail). But hey, leftovers are good too, right? :D
		  	</p>

        <h3>Trolling/Pranks</h3>
		  	<p>
          Have you ever heard the troll song originally sung by Edward Khil?  Well don’t worry if you haven’t, because you’re going to hear plenty of it when you live here!  We love playing pranks on each other, no matter how juvenile they might be.  Be forewarned!  Troll or be trolled in this entry!  And FYI, if you really do love the troll action, be sure to check out J2 for the daily Ron-talks-to-Kevin show that never fails to amuse.
		  	</p>

        <h3>Winter Gift Exchange</h3>
        <p>
          Right before Christmas time we have a gift exchange (white elephant/yankee swap type thing) within J. People buy some silly gifts and have a ball trying to take the best ones for ourselves.
        </p>

        <h3>Senior Dinner</h3>
        <p>
          Every year we like to dress up fancy pancy and go out to some restaurant to enjoy a nice dinner with our entry’s seniors as a sort-of farewell. We usually try to wrap up the night by spending time talking about (funny and embarrassing) memories/moments with the seniors.
        </p>

        <h3>Bowling</h3>
        <p>
          Every semester or so we venture out to the wilderness known as Alewife (actually, just the end of the red line) and compete for eternal glory. The game? Bowling.
        </p>

        <!-- <h3>Hiking</h3> -->

        <h3>Lounge Dwelling</h3>
        <p>
          In true MIT fashion, we (or at least some of us) like to procrastinate! So rather than focus on our work alone in our lovely singles we sometimes work in lounges just for the company and casual goofing around. Occasionally we find ourselves distracted...
        </p>

        <!--
        <h3>Apple Picking and Baking</h3>
        <p>

        </p>
      -->

        <h3>Brownie Night</h3>
        <p>
          Every week or so in the evening, we chow down on some delicious brownies.  It’s serves as a great break between studying/work, and everyone has a good time.  Oh and sorry to disappoint anyone, but they’re not laced with pot...at least last time I checked…
        </p>

        <!-- <h3>Birthday Fairy</h3> -->

        <!-- <h3>Mama J</h3> -->

        <!-- <h3>Easter Brunch</h3> -->

        <h3>Finals Breakfast</h3>
        <p>
          During finals week our lovely GRTs provide us with breakfast so we have one less thing to worry about during this stressful time. It’s a great time to relax before exams, hang out, and wish each other the best of luck!
        </p>

        <h3>Stressed Desserts</h3>
        <p>
          When under stress, one of the first impulses is to pig out on junk food and anything that offers you a delicious taste at maximum cost to your personal health, so why not do it with friends?  Once a semester, when we sense that the stress is getting high due to a ton of assignments/tests, we have a “Stressed Desserts” study break (stressed = desserts spelled backwards :D) where we can all pig out together and vent out all of our academic and personal frustrations at the world and MIT.
        </p>

        <!-- <h3>Teaching Study Break</h3> -->

        <h3>Bad Puns</h3>
        <p>
          They say laughter is great way to handle stress, and at MIT, we spend a lot of time laughing.  Jokes are a great way to do so, but as we are engineers and not liberal arts majors, our jokes can often come across as knee-slappers or super nerdy (don’t worry, once you start hanging out with people in your major, those puns will really take off).  Sometimes, we have those awkward moments when almost everyone misses the joke.  But ultimately, bad or good, awkward or not awkward, we love to make puns: they’re a great way to break out of the monotony that is PSets and classes.
